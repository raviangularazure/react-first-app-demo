NodeJS and npm to be installed (Actually only npm is used here to install packages. Nodejs is a prerequisiste for npm, thats allb)

npm i -g create-react-app (This will install all the react dependencies)

create-react-app react-app1 (Creates a brand new react application)
    - index.js (Starting point of react app)
    - Component based just like Angular 2+ (infact most concepts of Angular seem to be borrowed from React)
    - package.json (Contains all dependencies)

npm i bootstrap (Boostrap css classes have been used in this sample application)

React Component
    - A javascript class that inherits from React.Component
    - We do same ES5 module imports like we do in Angular 2+
    - React component has two main parts 
        - state (view model of the component)
        - render() (function that renders the html)
    - React Virtual DOM - We write jsx that updates a virtual DOM which in turn keeps the real HTML DOM is sync
    This is the reason why we write code in jsx syntax instead of directly access DOM element using javascript syntax in React

    - React JSX is not a templating engine like Angular 2+ - It does not have ngIf, ngFor etc. 
    - So these things have to be done via javascript functions such as map() to iterate through an array etc etc.

Events in React
    - Very similar to Angular 2+ e.g. onClick={this.state.handleSave()}
